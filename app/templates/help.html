        <h2>Using Olex2RTZ</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Go to the main page of the website.</li>
            <li>Upload your <strong>olexplot.gz</strong> or <strong>.rtz</strong> file by clicking on <strong>Analyze the file</strong>.</li>
            <li>After upload, you will see all routes and waypoints extracted from your file in a table format.</li>
            <li>Select a route from the dropdown menu to preview it on the interactive map.</li>
            <li>Optionally, enable the rename toggle to give your route a custom name before conversion.</li>
            <li>Choose your preferred output format: <strong>RTZ</strong> (default for .gz files) or <strong>GPX</strong> (default for .rtz files).</li>
            <li>Click on <strong>Convert</strong> to download the route in your selected format.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> The system automatically detects waypoints and organizes them correctly into a route. If your file contains routes with only one waypoint, you can use the filter toggle to show or hide them.</p>

        <h2>Advanced Features</h2>
        <p>Olex2RTZ offers additional options to process different types of navigation data from your files:</p>

        <h3>Routes</h3>
        <p>Enable this option to include unnamed routes (routes without a specific name) from your Olex file. These are typically routes that start with "Rute uten navn".</p>

        <h3>Traces</h3>
        <p>Enable this option to include trace routes from your Olex file. These are routes that contain "Slepestrek" in their name and represent navigation tracks or trails.</p>

        <h3>Waypoints</h3>
        <p>Enable this option to include single waypoints (routes with only one point) from your file. These can be useful for marking specific locations.</p>

        <p><strong>How to use:</strong> After uploading your file, check the boxes for the types of data you want to process before clicking "Analyze". This gives you more control over what gets converted.</p>

        <h3>Map Display</h3>
        <p>The map displays both routes and traces with visual distinctions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Routes:</strong> Displayed in blue color</li>
            <li><strong>Traces:</strong> Displayed in orange color for easy identification</li>
        </ul>
